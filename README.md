# MSc Cyber Security Dissertation: Building-trustworthy-AI-Assisted-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System

   Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained remarkable attention from human experts in deciding high-stake scenarios. A key to the success of AI-assisted decision making, where human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the AI models to ensure task success, is to analyze the factors that potentially impact human trust in the AI models, improving the 
accuracy of decision making in case that the model performs poorly. The objective of the project is to evaluate a variety of AI models on potential network attack pattern detection and how to incorporate these factors to develop a more trustworthy AI-assisted decision-making system.
